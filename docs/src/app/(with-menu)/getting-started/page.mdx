</Flash>

## Install

After you can install the library with this npm package.

```bash
npm install maplibre-react-components
```

## Styling

Like the Vanilla MapLibre library, you will need to add one MapLibre compatible stylesheet.

```tsx
import "maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css";
```

If you want to use the `RGradientMarker` component, you will need to add an additional stylesheet.

```ts
import "maplibre-react-components/style.css";
```


Optional : If you want to add one modern stylesheet, you can install `maplibre-theme`. And use his `modern` style.

```bash
npm install maplibre-theme
```
```diff
- import "maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css";
+ import "maplibre-theme/icons.default.css";
+ import "maplibre-theme/modern.css";
```

## Compatibility

One of the objectives of this library was to offer as little abstraction as possible
with `MapLibre`. If you use `TypeScript` you will quickly realize that in many cases you
are manipulating the latter's native types. However this also has a cost, this library is
not compatible with `mapbox-gl`.

However, you can use the library with a fork of mapLibre by adding these lines in
your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "maplibre-gl": "npm:<your-maplibre-fork>"
  }
}
```
